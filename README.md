# Multilingual Glossary Frontend
This project is about the frontend of the translation website. It allowed users to see a table contains translations in different languages. Users are also able to search for keywords in real-time and display optional languages. In the future, we will allow users to download the table into a .csv file, so they can use it in other places. 

The framework we use in this project is the [REACT](https://reactjs.org/).
